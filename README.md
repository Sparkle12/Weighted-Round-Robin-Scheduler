# Weighted-Round-Robin-Scheduler
A weighted round robin scheduler simulator that runs in user-land. The project has 2 parts, the CPU struct and the Program struct.
- The program struct generates the proccess (using the fork() syscall). The proccess inherit the programs weight with an offset between [-2,2] and an execution time equal to the average execution time with an offset between [-variance,variance] (field in the Program struct). The procces generation runs on a separate thread in order to simulate a single-core CPU (you can create new procceses as the CPU computes existing ones).
- The CPU struct simulates the execution of the proccess created by the Program struct using a circular linked list and signaling. When a proccess is created it gets paused (using SIGSTOP) then it gets added to a global procces queue. After that it gets added to the CPU's queue in order to be proccesed. The procceses are executed by unpauseing them (using SIGCONT) and letting it execute for weight * time_quantum, after that it gets paused again. When the procces finnishes it sends a SIGCHLD that is proccesed by the CPU thread and using an atomic variable we detect the termination of a procces.
